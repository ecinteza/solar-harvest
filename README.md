# Solar Harvest

Solar Harvest is an engaging C# project designed as an interactive game that simulates solar energy collection and strategic management. The game challenges players to efficiently harvest solar energy while navigating various terrains, encouraging both strategic thinking and fun gameplay.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players collect solar energy and manage resources in a dynamic environment.
- **Multiple Maps**: Different levels and terrains provide unique challenges and enhance replayability.
- **Menu System**: User-friendly menu interface for starting new games and navigating between options.
- **Core Mechanics**: Energy collection, terrain navigation, and strategy implementation.

## Project Structure

The project is built around several key C# classes:

- **`Program.cs`**: The main entry point that initializes and runs the game.
- **`Game.cs`**: Manages game logic, player interactions, and core gameplay mechanics.
- **`Maps.cs`**: Defines the map structures and varying terrain types.
- **`Menu.cs`**: Handles the main menu operations and player choices.
